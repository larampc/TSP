## Routing for Ocean Shipping and Urban Deliveries Algorithms Program

### Project description
This program was made for DA course unit of Bachelor in Informatics and Computing Engineering at FEUP. This program has algorithms options for finding optimal or approximated routes for vehicles in generic shipping and delivery scenarios, from urban deliveries to ocean shipping.
 
### What can this project do?
Choose the scenario for which you would like to find a route.

Run different algorithms such as:
- Backtracking;
- Triangular Approximation Heuristic;
- Nearest Insertion;
- Nearest Neighbour;
- Other Heuristic;
- Two opt.

Change settings such as:
- Enabling colour mode;
- Load a different scenario.

> Final grade: 19.7
